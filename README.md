# Ping Pong
#### By **Nicholas Muturi**

## Description
This is a website that allows users to play a small logical game called Ping Pong. The website takes a number from the user via a form and prints the list of the number inserted. However, if the number is divisible by 3 - it returns a string "ping". If the number is divisible by 5, it returns a string "pong" and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it returns "ping pong".

**EXAMPLE**
| Number Inserted | Expected Output
| 3 | 1, 2, ping
| 5 | 1, 2, ping, 4,  pong
| 15 | .... 11, ping, 13, 14, ping pong

In the event a user inserts a string or blank result, the form shall not generate a list and instead insist on valid input
